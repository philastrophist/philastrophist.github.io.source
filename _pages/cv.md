## Summary
 About me


 *Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, FRAS*



## Research Interests
* **Star-formation**: LOFAR, FIR, empirical relations, FIRC, MagPhys, SFG-AGN interface.
* **Reverberation mapping**: High redshift, photometric techniques, $$t_{lag}-L_{5100}$$, selection
biases.
* **Big data & Bayesian analysis**: Large surveys, advanced Bayesian statistical inference, bias mitigation.


## Experience
**Ph.D. student**  
*University of Hertfordshire*, Oct 2015 - Present  
Supervisor: Dr Daniel J.B. Smith  
Thesis: Measuring the Physical Properties of Distant Galaxies and Black
Holes in the Era of Surveys  
-   Studying the relation between the star-formation rate and radio
    luminosity of galaxies.
-   Using new photometric time-series techniques to estimate quasar
    black-hole masses using reverberation mapping.
-   Innovating new Bayesian methods to infer complete distributions from
    incomplete, noisy data in order to mitigate observational bias and
    explore large datasets.

**Observing**  
*William Herschel Telescope, La Palma*, Jun 2016 -   
  
  


**Programming teaching assistant & tutor**  
*University of Hertfordshire, UK*, Jan 2016 - Present  
  
  
-   Taught students Python and Matlab for scientific programming
    courses.
-   Assisted students with programming exercises.
-   Lead programming lectures and demonstrations.

**'Physics of stars' demonstrator**  
*University of Hertfordshire, UK*, Nov 2016 - Mar 2017  
  
  
-   Assisted students at the Bayfordbury teaching observatory.
-   Instructed in the use of 16-inch telescopes and the reduction of
    data.
-   Projects included PNe imaging and constructing open cluster
    HR-diagrams.

**Insight Analyst**  
*Linkdex, UK*, Jul 2014 - Jul 2015  
Processing big data from raw consumer search patterns to an explanative
format suitable for client business strategies.  
  
-   Big data processing with Python & sci-kit learn
-   Communication with the backend team
-   API design, visualisation, and automation development.

**Summer Student**  
*National Physical Laboratory, UK*, Jun 2013 - Aug 2013  
**Supervisor**: Dr Alastair Sinclair  
  
-   Worked with the Time & Frequency Team.
-   Analysed Gaussian beam quality for the strontium ion optical clock
    group.
-   Developed analytical Matlab code and the optical bench setup
    required.
