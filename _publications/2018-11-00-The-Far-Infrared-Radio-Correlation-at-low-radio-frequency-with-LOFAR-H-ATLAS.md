 The radio and far-infrared luminosities of star-forming galaxies are
tightly correlated over several orders of magnitude; this is known as
the far-infrared radio correlation (FIRC). Previous studies have shown
that a host of factors conspire to maintain a tight and linear FIRC,
despite many models predicting deviation. This discrepancy between
expectations and observations is concerning since a linear FIRC
underpins the use of radio luminosity as a star-formation rate
indicator. Using LOFAR 150 MHz , FIRST 1.4 GHz , and Herschel infrared
luminosities derived from the new LOFAR/H-ATLAS catalogue, we
investigate possible variation in the monochromatic ( 250 μm) FIRC at
low and high radio frequencies. We use statistical techniques to probe
the FIRC for an optically selected sample of 4082 emission-line
classified star-forming galaxies as a function of redshift, effective
dust temperature, stellar mass, specific star formation rate, and
mid-infrared colour (an empirical proxy for specific star formation
rate). Although the average FIRC at high radio frequency is consistent
with expectations based on a standard power-law radio spectrum, the
average correlation at 150 MHz is not. We see evidence for redshift
evolution of the FIRC at 150 MHz, and find that the FIRC varies with
stellar mass, dust temperature, and specific star formation rate,
whether the latter is probed using MAGPHYS fitting, or using
mid-infrared colour as a proxy. We can explain the variation, to within
1σ, seen in the FIRC over mid-infrared colour by a combination of dust
temperature, redshift, and stellar mass using a Bayesian partial
correlation technique.
