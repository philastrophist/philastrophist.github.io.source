 We present Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) High-Band Array observations of
the Herschel-ATLAS North Galactic Pole survey area. The survey we have
carried out, consisting of four pointings covering around 142
deg<SUP>2</SUP> of sky in the frequency range 126-173 MHz, does not
provide uniform noise coverage but otherwise is representative of the
quality of data to be expected in the planned LOFAR wide-area surveys,
and has been reduced using recently developed \`facet calibration'
methods at a resolution approaching the full resolution of the data sets
(̃10 × 6 arcsec) and an rms off-source noise that ranges from 100 μJy
beam<SUP>-1</SUP> in the centre of the best fields to around 2 mJy
beam<SUP>-1</SUP> at the furthest extent of our imaging. We describe the
imaging, cataloguing and source identification processes, and present
some initial science results based on a 5σ source catalogue. These
include (I) an initial look at the radio/far-infrared correlation at 150
MHz, showing that many Herschel sources are not yet detected by LOFAR;
(II) number counts at 150 MHz, including, for the first time,
observational constraints on the numbers of star-forming galaxies; (III)
the 150-MHz luminosity functions for active and star-forming galaxies,
which agree well with determinations at higher frequencies at low
redshift, and show strong redshift evolution of the star-forming
population; and (IV) some discussion of the implications of our
observations for studies of radio galaxy life cycles.
