Astronomy is one of the few sciences where we can't run our experiments again and again.
Instead, we have only one experimental result: our universe!
Worse, our instruments are imperfect and we can only see a small part of any sample of galaxies.
To make matters even more difficult, the greater the distance that you observe at, the further you look back in time. This adds yet another bias to our observations.
