summary: |
  I am a postdoctoral researcher specialising in Bayesian statistical analysis on big data, working on the weak-lensing colour-gradient bias with Euclid .
  My main interests are reverberation mapping and the interface between star-forming galaxies and AGN. 
  I have worked with a diverse range of data including the latest releases from the LOFAR, SDSS, and H-ATLAS surveys and the Horizon-AGN simulations. 
  My latest work combines the use of novel statistical Bayesian analysis with these large datasets in order to facilitate effective exploitation of the 
  next generation of surveys.
