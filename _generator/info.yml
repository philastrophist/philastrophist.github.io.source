summary: |
  I am a postdoctoral researcher specialising in Bayesian statistical analysis on big data, working on the weak-lensing colour-gradient bias with Euclid .
  My main interests are reverberation mapping and the interface between star-forming galaxies and AGN. 
  I have worked with a diverse range of data including the latest releases from the LOFAR, SDSS, and H-ATLAS surveys and the Horizon-AGN simulations. 
  My latest work combines the use of novel statistical Bayesian analysis with these large datasets in order to facilitate effective exploitation of the 
  next generation of surveys.

    abstract: |
      Accurate methods for reverberation mapping using photometry are highly sought after since they are inherently less resource intensive than spectroscopic techniques. 
      However, the effectiveness of photometric reverberation mapping for estimating black hole masses is sparsely investigated at redshifts higher than z≈0.04. 
      Furthermore, photometric methods frequently assume a Damped Random Walk (DRW) model, which may not be universally applicable. 
      We perform photometric reverberation mapping using the Javelin photometric DRW model for the QSO SDSSJ144645.44+625304.0 at z=0.351 and estimate the Hβ lag of 65<sup>+6</sup><sub>-1</sub> days and black-hole mass of 10<sup>8.22<sup>+0.13</sup><sub>-0.15</sub></sup>M<sub>⊙</sub>. 
      An analysis of the reliability of photometric reverberation mapping, conducted using many thousands of simulated CARMA process light-curves, shows that we can recover the input lag to within 6 per cent on average given our target's observed signal-to-noise of > 20 and an average cadence of 14 days (even when DRW is not applicable). 
      Furthermore, we use our suite of simulated light curves to deconvolve aliases and artefacts from our QSO's posterior probability distribution, increasing the signal-to-noise on the lag by a factor of ∼2.2. 
      We exceed the signal-to-noise of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping Project (SDSS-RM) campaign with a quarter of the observing time per object, resulting in a ∼200 per cent increase in SNR efficiency over SDSS-RM.
